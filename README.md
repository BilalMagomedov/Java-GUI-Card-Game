Welcome to the Card Match Game! This is a simple card game where you'll be pitted against the computer in a card-matching showdown.

## Rules

1. If the suits of your card and the computer's card match, you earn 3 points.
2. If the ranks of your card and the computer's card match, you earn 5 points.
3. If both the suits and ranks match, you earn a whopping 10 points.
4. To secure victory, you need to amass more than 24 points.
5. However, if you fail to achieve the 24-point target, you'll find yourself on the losing end.
